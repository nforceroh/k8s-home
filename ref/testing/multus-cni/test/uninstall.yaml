# Define a pod with macvlan-conf, defined above, with ip address and mac, and 
# "gateway" overrides default gateway to use macvlan-conf's one. 
# without "gateway" in k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks, default route will be cluster
# network interface, eth0, even tough macvlan-conf has default gateway config.
